# Refactored Webpage
From the starter code, the div soup has been cleaned up and replaced with appropriate semantic tags, and the css has been altered to conform to best practices. The Search Engine Optimization link in the navigator was also fixed, and a new title was added.  Appropriate alt tags were also added to the images to enhance accessibility.
