# Refactored Horiseon Webpage
    The starter code was an example of div soup.  There were no semantic tags, instead just a lot of class distinctions creating a lot of unecessary code in CSS. 
    To fix this problem, all the div tags were replaced with their appropriate semantic tags, allowing me to clean up the CSS code.
    This makes the code easier to read and change in the future.

    I also grouped the code in CSS according to what section it applies to in HTML, and I gave each section a comment explaining what the code is for, again to help future developers read and understand the code.

    There was also a broken link on the website which I fixed to make the site properly functional.
